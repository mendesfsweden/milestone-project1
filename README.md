### MS1 -User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This website is for a recently created portuguese ceramic company. Their intent is to expand the business to the international market as portuguese ceramic is so popular all around the world. The ultimate goal is to turn this project into a online store, written in at least 3 different languages - English, Swedish and Portuguese.

## Features

A navigation bar is used in this project and it is visible at all times, as the user scrolls down the page. The navigation bar collapses on tablet screens and smaller into a button that extends vertically once clicked on.
This project uses the Parallax Scrolling effect to create a perception of depth as the user scrolls.

### Features Left to Implement

Develop the different categories in the "My Work" section. Ultimatelly, the goal is to turn this website into a online store. 

## Testing

All links were tested and work perfectly. Facebook and Linkedin links are redirected to each of the plattforms home page while the Instagram link will open "antónio-ceramic" Instagram account. The "Send" button located in the contact section will take the user back to the home section, as well as all the different categories in the "My Work" Section.

This project was tested on Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, iOS devices (iPhone Xs and Ipad) and Android (Huawei P30). 

The navigation bar works perfectly in all screens/browsers.

## Bugs

### Background image on iOS devices

Background images, when manipulated (e.g. position:fixed), do not work well on iOS devices. The images become too big for the screen so  can only be seen partially and with a terrible quality. Solution was based on another Github colaborator page - the link can be found at the bottom of this readme file in the Acknowledgments section.
