### MS1 -User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This website is for a recently created portuguese ceramic company. Their intent is to expand the business to the international market as portuguese ceramic is so popular all around the world. The ultimate goal is to turn this project into a online store, written in at least 3 different languages - English, Swedish and Portuguese.

## Testing

All links were tested and work perfectly. Facebook and Linkedin links are redirected to each of the plattforms home page while the Instagram link will open "antónio-ceramic" Instagram account. The "Send" button located in the contact section will take the user back to the home section, as well as all the different categories in the "My Work" Section.

This project was tested on Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, iOS devices (iPhone Xs and Ipad) and Android (Huawei P30). 

A navigation bar is visible at all times, as the user scrolls down the page, collapsing on tablet screens and smaller into a button that extends vertically once clicked on.
